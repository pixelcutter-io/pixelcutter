Notula was born from a simple frustration: managing occasional performance invoices (notule) in Italy shouldn't require spreadsheets, confusion, and constant worry about progressive numbering. This free web application transforms a tedious bureaucratic task into a streamlined, two-click process.

The app automatically handles everything freelancers typically struggle with: progressive numbering, amount tracking, submission dates, and client data storage. No more hunting through old documents for VAT numbers or wondering «what number was I up to?» Simply select a client, enter the amount and description, and Notula fills in all the remaining details automatically.

Beyond just invoice creation, Notula serves as a complete management tool with a built-in client database that stores fiscal codes, VAT numbers, and addresses for instant retrieval. The project also includes an educational FAQ section addressing common Italian tax questions, helping users understand the often-confusing regulations around occasional invoices.
